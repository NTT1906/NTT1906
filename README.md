- Hi everyone, I'm NTT and I'm a 15 year old student. I am a student specializing in Physics but I have a fun with coding. I know Php and I am learning more....<br>
- Thanks for reading this <3

"Are ya winning, son?"
"Yes thanks dad,
and I thank you for coming and asking that,
I appreciate you trying to,
ask me though you may not understand"

"Are ya winning, son?"
"No dad, the shame
I just donated three thousand dollars so this girl would say my name
Forgive me for what I've done..."
"I cannot believe that you've become a simp son"

"Are ya winning, son?"
"Dad no, I'm not, and dad it's taking it's toll, a lot, three thousand hours, I've played this game, joined a tournament today, and guess what dad, I didn't win dad, so all i've done dad, has been for nothing dad, I'm feeling real bad, it isn't even dad, that I've not won, you see the thing is dad, it's stopped being that fun, being that fun
I'm so sorry, you've seen me like this, I'm a failure maybe it's time to quit, but thanks for asking, at least I tried, now leave me alone to sit and cry"

"Are ya winning, son?"
"I've trascended, beyond the need for dualistic notions of competitive, but i'm humbled dad, you came to me, so please come sit beside your son for a cup of tea"

"Are ya winning, son?"
"Not exactly, the only things i'm winning here is good old memories
Like all the good times you knocked my door, asking once again if I was winning like before
Though things have changed now
And though it's sad 
It's time for me to ask...

Are ya winning, dad?
Even though I know that you are winning dad...
When you asked me it meant I was winning dad..."
